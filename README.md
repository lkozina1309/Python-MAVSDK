### Description

PX4 is the Professional Autopilot. Developed by world-class developers from industry and academia, and supported by an active world wide community, it powers all kinds of vehicles from racing and cargo drones through to ground vehicles and submersibles. MAVSDK is a collection of libraries for various programming languages to interface with MAVLink systems such as drones, cameras or ground systems. 

My repository contains 3 simple scripts used on a real drone. One script is used for connection and simple takeoff and landing, just to test if everything is OK. The third one is used for flying to exact points and orbiting around my neighbourhood, but with a few adjustments, it can be used for flying anywhere. The forth is used for flying in AUTO mode.
