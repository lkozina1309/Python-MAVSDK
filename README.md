# Python-MAVSDK

Python-MAVSDK is library with scripts using python-mavsdk. 

It contains 3 simple scripts used on a real drone. 2 scripts are used for connection and simple takeoff and landing, just to test if everything is OK. The third one is used for flying to exactpoints and orbiting around my neighbourhood, but with a few adjustments, it can be used for flying anywhere.
